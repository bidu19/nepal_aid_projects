Aid Projects Dataset, Version 1.0 for the bachelorthesis of Beat Mueller 'The allocation of Chinese and Indian development finance in Nepal and its influence on local election results'

The Aidprojects Dataset contains all ODA disbursements from India and China in Nepal, reported by Aiddata at William and Mary. For Chinese projects, information is available between 2008 and 2017, for India between 2008 and 2015. Data for the year 2015 was directly collected from the 'MEA Outcome Budget' from the Ministry of External Affairs of India. The project locations are displayed with various levels of precision. Also included are the dataset: 'List of Winning Candidates, Constituent Assembly Election 2064' and 'List of Winning Candidates, Constituent Assembly Election 2070'. 

About the data collection process

First, I extract data on Chinese projects from AidDataâ€™s Global Chinese Official Finance Dataset, Version 2.0 (\citealp{custer_tracking_2021}), that are geocoded and match the following criteria: Nepal as recipient; 2008-2017 as commitment year; and ODA-like as flow class. Consistent with the OECD criteria, ODA-like flows aim to promote the economic development and welfare of recipient countries, are concessional in character and convey a grant element of at least. Project data that is verified and released by the Chinese government is not available. Second, I do the same on Indian projects from AidData's Indian Development Finance Dataset, Version 1.0. Here, in contrast to Chinese disbursements, the project data is provided by two major Indian agencies, the Ministry of External Affairs and the Exim Bank. One limitation is that data is only available until 2014. Therefore, I compiled additional information on development projects for the year 2015 from the Outcome Budget 2016-2017 retrieved directly from the Ministry of External Affairs. I only added project information which include a location; an exact amount spent; and matched the ODA definition from above. Mostly, the projects were continuations or follow ups to preceding ones, thus enabling a uniform definition throughout the new dataset. For 2016 and 2017, data is unfortunately lacking, as the Ministry of External Affairs did not anymore publish any precise data concerning its development finance. Taken together, I compiled information on 642 ODA-disbursements, which contain 46 entries for China and 596 for India. Only projects whose locations are identifiable at least at the district level are included in my sample. Thus, I can allocate each entry to a respective district, province and development region of Nepal. In the original datasets, this information was not uniformly displayed or sometimes not correct by confusing district with provinces or locations or vice-versa. In addition, the new dataset also displays information on the title of eacg development project, its sectoral distribution, the respective funding agency, and at minimum one source URL.
